Thanks to all the great people who made this defcon
worth attending. See all of you next year.


STM32 firmware was developed in CooCox IDE / GCC

ATtiny88 firmware was developed in Atmel Studio 6.2

Yeah, all this shit is Windows. Windows isn't required
to build this firmware but it is up to you to get
your ARM and AVR toolchains together to build it.

Use any ST Discovery or Nucleo board to program and
debug the STM32. Cost is ~$8-15 and you get a devboard.

Use an expensive Atmel debugger to debug the ATtiny88.
The code is pretty simple though so maybe you can
just simulate it instead. You can use a USBasp to
program the ATtiny88; cost is ~$3-8.


Binaries are provided and compiled from this source.

STM32 compiled firmware:
  firmware_stm32/build/Standalone/Debug/bin
ATtiny88 compiled firmware:
  firmware_attiny/Debug


Schematic shows all connections as expected on PCB.
This was a learning project for a Whiskey Pirate
so I made it easy for him to understand. I'm also
a low level electrical wizard so I don't know what
I am doing.


Forgive the shit code, I don't know what I'm doing.
